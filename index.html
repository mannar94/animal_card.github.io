			<p> Cats have a reflective layer in their eyes,which magnifies incoming light allowing them to see up to 6 times better than humans can in low light. Cats  also have a ‘third eyelid’  which is found on the inside corner of the eye which is an extra protective function of the eye.
            Psychological studies have shown that cat owners are more logical and practical than dog owners. They tend to be more introverted than dog owners. Cat owners tell more stories about their cats than dog owners.</p>
